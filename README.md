# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was built to help me understand the basics of coding and how to get started in building a webpage by using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each of the four sections has notes to review. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
